## Component Previews

We built a little preview system to show off some of the components used on this site. [Take a peek here.](/components)

Our goal is to eventually release this as a standalone plugin, but in the meantime feel free to [grab the code out of our repository](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/tree/master/bridgetown-website).

## The Includes Tag (Deprecated)

Migrating to `render`:

* Files must not contain hyphens (`-`), use underscores instead (`_`).
* You don't need to use extensions. It's automatically either HTML or Liquid.
