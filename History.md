## 0.4.0 / 2020-04-05

  * Added a `component` Liquid tag which extends the functionality of include tags.
  * Added a new `bridgetown-website` project to the repo, which of course is a Bridgetown site and will house the homepage, documentation, etc.

## 0.3.0 / 2020-04-05

  * Moved all Bridgetown code to `bridgetown-core`, the idea being this will now be a monorepo housing Core plus a few other official gems/projects as time goes on. Users will install the `bridgetown` gem which in turns installs `bridgetown-core` as a dependency.

## 0.2.0 / 2020-04-04

  * Completed comprehensive code audio and changed or removed features no
    longer required for the project. Fixed and successfully ran test suite
    accordingly.

## 0.1.0 / 2020-04-02

  * First version after fork from pre-released Jekyll 4.1
