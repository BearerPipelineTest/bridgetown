Bridgetown is a Webpack-aware, Ruby-powered static site generator for the modern [Jamstack](https://bridgetownrb.com/docs/jamstack/) era. Bridgetown takes your content and frontend assets, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and exports a complete website ready to be served by Jamstack services like Netlify or traditional web servers like Nginx.

## Stability Noticeâ€¦

Given Bridgetown's strong inherited bones (see background below) and our continued
emphasis on good testing, we're pretty confident Bridgetown is ready to use today.
Butâ€¦you might want to exercise a bit of extra caution using this in production. ðŸ™‚
We are already (after all, the Bridgetown website is built with Bridgetown), but YMMV.

## Background

Bridgetown started life as a fork of the granddaddy of static site generators, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Spearheaded by Portland-based web studio [Whitefusion](https://whitefusion.io) and with a brand new set of [project goals](https://bridgetownrb.com/docs/philosophy/) and [a future roadmap](https://bridgetownrb.com/about/), our pledge is to ramp up adding new features at a steady and predictable pace, grow the open source community around the project, and ensure a lively future for a top-tier Ruby-based static site generator moving forward.

## Testing Locally

If you'd like to hack away on Bridgetown directly, you'll need to clone this repo and ensure the test suite passes. Note that this is a "monorepo", meaning that multiple Rubygem codebases are stored within a single repo.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:bridgetownrb/bridgetown.git
$ cd bridgetown
$ bundle # install development gems
$ bundle exec rake # run the full test suite
```

After making changes in `bridgetown-core`, if you want to run a single unit test, you can use the command:

```shell
$ script/test test/blah_test.rb
```

If you are only updating a Cucumber .feature file, you can use the command:

```shell
$ script/cucumber features/blah.feature
```

Both `script/test` and `script/cucumber` can be run without arguments to run its entire respective suite.

To switch one of your website repos to using the local gem, alter the site's Gemfile as follows:

```ruby
gem "bridgetown-core", path: "/path/to/bridgetown/bridgetown-core"
```
