Bridgetown is a Webpack-aware, Ruby-based static site generator for the modern JAMstack era. It's perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Bridgetown takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by JAMstack services like Netlify or traditional web servers like Nginx.

## Philosophy

Bridgetown does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Bridgetown gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.
